About Myself
----------------------------------------
*Thank you reader for your attention to these lines of text.*

Several years of life in search of a goal and direction of work led me to the path of a developer.
Now the Developer is not just a profession, but a whole path and direction for me. The main benefit is the improvement in the thinking process that is inherent in wise developers. This is one of the valuable skills that is built in the process of becoming a programmer. This is one of the goals that led me to this path, which I confidently continue to follow. The desire for growth in this specialty began to give rise to techniques and practices for self-development. With those thoughts came action. After changing my job from a technical support position in a hosting company to a Web FrontEnd developer position, it allowed me to reveal new sides that now need to be steadily developed. At the moment, one of the priority goals is
improvement of web development techniques throughout the entire production cycle.
